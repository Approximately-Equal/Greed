title: When to transition from exact to approximate pmf

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
pmf <- read.csv("./greed_pmf_comparison_2.csv")
```

```{r}
avg_pmf <- pmf %>%
  group_by(n, s) %>%
  summarize(avg_diff = mean(diff), .groups = "drop")
```

```{r}
approximable_pmfs <- avg_pmf %>% filter(avg_diff < 0.005)
```

```{r}
approximable_pmfs %>%
  group_by(n) %>%
  summarize(boundary_s = min(s))
```

```{r}
approximable_pmfs %>% filter(n < 25) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = n, y = s)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
approximable_pmfs %>% filter(s == 9) %>% select(n) %>% summarize(min = min(n))
```
