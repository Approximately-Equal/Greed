# Greed

## Background

Greed is a dice-based two-player game where players try to get as close to the max values as possible without going bust, with the player whose score is higher at the end of play winning. This project aims to determine the optimal way to play the game.

## Reference

1. `report` documents the process and math behind the algorithm that calculates the probabilities of winning and which moves will optimize that probabilty.

2. `presentation` documents my colloquium slides.

3. The `src` directory is all the code necessary to actually perform the algorithm.
